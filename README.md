This repo contains the source code to the unlicensed NES game *The P'Radikus Conflict* released by Color Dreams in 1990.

The master branch contains the original source preserved as-is from a floppy disk that was acquired in an eBay auction, as well as the pre-built PRG and CHR ROMs which were also included on the disk.

The `ca65` branch contains an unofficial conversion of the source to make it buildable using the ca65 assembler. A makefile is included.
